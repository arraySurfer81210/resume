# First Nations Geospatial Automation Case Study

## Overview
This case study demonstrates how modern geospatial automation can enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of First Nations referral workflows. The project integrates **Python**, **ArcGIS Pro**, and **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)** to automate geodatabase management, streamline ETL (Extract‚ÄìTransform‚ÄìLoad) processes, and configure interactive web applications for decision support.

## Objectives
- Build an automated geospatial ETL pipeline using **ArcPy** and **Python**.  
- Integrate data from multiple proponents and project years into a unified geodatabase structure.  
- Standardize geometry, projection, and schema for consistent data analysis.  
- Configure an **ArcGIS Experience Builder** application for accessible map visualization and search.  
- Improve accuracy, reduce manual data handling, and support faster decision-making for First Nations governance.

## Features
- üì¶ Automated ingestion of shapefiles and geodatabases from synced SharePoint sources.  
- üß© Intelligent feature renaming and projection to `NAD 1983 BC Environment Albers (WKID 3005)`.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular Python scripts for ingestion, centroids, dissolves, and AGOL publishing.  
- üîç Streamlined Experience Builder interface with optimized pop-ups, legends, and search functionality.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Processing time reductions of up to 80% compared to manual workflows.

## Tools and Technologies
- **ArcGIS Pro / ArcPy**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **VS Code + Git / GitHub**
- **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)**
- **SharePoint / OneDrive Integration**
