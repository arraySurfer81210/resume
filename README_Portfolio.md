# First Nations Geospatial Automation Case Study

## Summary
This project showcases the application of **data automation and geospatial engineering** to modernize a complex First Nations referral workflow.  
Using **Python**, **ArcGIS Pro**, and **ArcGIS Online**, it replaces manual data entry with automated ETL pipelines, spatial validation, and interactive web mapping — reducing processing time from days to hours while improving data integrity and stakeholder accessibility.

## Highlights
- 🚀 **End-to-end automation:** Built Python/ArcPy scripts that ingest, clean, transform, and publish geospatial data to ArcGIS Online.  
- 📊 **Data engineering at scale:** Managed multi-year project datasets exceeding 6,000 spatial records within multi-GB geodatabases.  
- 🧠 **Intelligent schema logic:** Standardized and projected datasets automatically to `WKID 3005` (BC Albers).  
- 🌐 **Interactive visualization:** Configured an ArcGIS Experience Builder web app with searchable, mobile-friendly map interfaces.  
- ⏱️ **Efficiency gains:** Cut mapping and data processing time by up to **80%**, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.  
- 💡 **GitHub integration:** Version-controlled codebase with reproducible workflows for collaborative development and transparency.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Engineering:** Python (ArcPy, Pandas), ETL design, schema standardization  
- **GIS Development:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, Experience Builder  
- **Automation:** Scripting, logging, batch processing, spatial projection handling  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, VS Code integration  
- **Communication:** Technical documentation and workflow transparency for multi-stakeholder teams
