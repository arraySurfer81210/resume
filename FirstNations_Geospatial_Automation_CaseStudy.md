## 🪶 1️⃣ Professional Summary (cover-letter-style)

As a Registered Professional Forester and GIS automation specialist, I led the development of a **cloud-based geospatial data system** to support a **First Nations referral process** involving multiple industry proponents and major resource projects.
The project modernized an outdated, manual workflow into an automated, data-driven system that integrates **ETL automation, spatial analytics, and interactive web mapping** to improve accuracy and drastically reduce processing time.

Using **Python, ArcPy, and GitHub-based version control**, I designed reproducible pipelines for large-scale data transformation — more than **3,800 lines of code** across **12 modular scripts** — standardizing and spatially aligning thousands of project records from multiple data sources.
The resulting application, built in **ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online Experience Builder**, supports real-time search by proponent and referral number, generates overlap analytics with traditional territory boundaries, and provides field-ready mobile access through a streamlined interface.

This initiative demonstrates my ability to integrate **automation, analytics, and stakeholder engagement** — bridging data engineering and community-based resource management to support informed, transparent decision-making.
